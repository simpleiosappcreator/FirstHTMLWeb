            <h3>1. Wonton</h3>
            <img src="images/ChinaCuisine/China-Wonton.jpg" alt="Wonton" />
            <p>
              Wonton is a traditional snack originating in the North of China.
              They are also popular in the south. Even its name “wonton” comes
              from Cantonese. With a variety of packaging, fillings, and cooking
              methods, wonton has all kinds of local flavors. In Northern China,
              wonton is always filled with celery (or cabbage) and minced mutton
              (or beef or pork). In the Guangdong area, wonton is usually
              stuffed with shrimp and minced pork and is served with noodles to
              make wonton noodles. In Hong Kong, wonton is fried in hot oil
              until it becomes golden and crispy, called “Fried Wonton”. In the
              Fujian area, wonton is served with a light soup.

            <p>
              Sweet and Sour Pork is one of the classics of Chinese cuisine. No
              one can reject its sweet and sour mix flavor and bright
              appearance. Some people don’t eat pork, so some restaurants change
              it to Sweet and Sour Chicken, which shows how adorable its taste
              is. The dish is particularly popular in the Shanghai area.

            <h3>3. Spring Rolls</h3>

            <p>
              Spring rolls are fried pancakes with different fillings in south
              China. Those from Shanghai and Guangdong are the best known. The
              name is intrinsically linked to the Chinese New Year. In the past,
              the Chinese had the custom of having spring rolls to mark the end
              of winter and the beginning of spring. The filling can be either
              sweet or savory depending on your preference. For a sweet filling,
              sweetened bean paste is a good choice. For a savory one, Chinese
              cabbage and shredded pork are particularly popular, while shredded
              bamboo shoots and mushrooms can be added for good measure. The
              skins of perfect spring rolls should be crispy, and the filling
              tender.
